                <h3>Changing an Elements Position with translate()</h3>
                <p>
                    The <code>translate()</code> function and its sinlge-axis counterpart <code>translateX()</code> and <code>translatey()</code> have a similar effect as relative positioning. They move an element from its default position without affecting the position of surrounding elements. Used in combination with other transfrom function, they can move an element at the same time as scaling, rotating, or skewing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please use inspect tool as I have the css codes there
                </p>

                <h3>Rotating Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    To rotate an element, use the <code>transform</code> property and set its value with <code>rotate()</code> function, which takes an angle as its argument. You can express the angle using degrees, radians, gradians, or turns. Degrees and turns are the easiest to use. One turn is equal to 350deg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the inspect tool to take control of the css

                <h3>Changing the Acnhor Point with transform-origin</h3>
                <p>
                    By default, 2D transforms originate from the center of an element. With <code>translate()</code>, it makes no difference where the movement is calculated from. The result is always the same. However, within the other transform fucntions, it can make a significant difference. Bellow the images are rotated around their center points. But you can change the anchor point using the <code>transform-origin</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the inspect tool to modify the transform-origin
                </p>
                <div id="transform-origin-con">
                    <img src="./img/26.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>Scaling Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    To scale an element, use the <code>transform</code> property and set its value with the <code>scaleX() scaleY() scale()</code> functions. The first two functions take a number as their sole argument, and use it as a scaling factor for the X or Y axis, respectively. For example, below contains three identical images. The first one is renderes at its normal size, but the second one is scaled to half its normal width, and the third one to half its normal height. By default, scaling is done from the center of an element.
                </p>
                <div id="scale-con">
                    <img src="./img/13.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="./img/13.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="./img/13.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The <code>scale()</code> function accepts one or two arguments. If you pass it a single number, the same scaling factor is applied to both axes. If you pass it two numbers seperated by a comma, the first is used as the scaling factor for X axis and the second for the Y axis
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex;gap: 1rem;margin: 1rem;">

                <h3>Flipping Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    The table above does not contain a transform function to flip elements horizontally or vertically, but you can achieve the same effect by passing negative values to <code>scaleX() scaleY() scale()</code>. Setting the value to -1 preserves the original size, but flips the element on the relevant axis. 
                </p>

                <h3>Skewing Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    To skew an element, use the <code>transform</code> property and set its values by passing an angle as the argument to <code>skewX() skewY</code>. With <code>skewX()</code>, a positive angle skews the element to the left, and negative angle skews it to the right. With <code>skewY()</code>, a positive angle skews the elements vertically and rotates it in a clockwise direction. A negative angle rotates it in an anticlockwise direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use inspect tool

                <h3>Transforming Elements with the matrix() Function</h3>
                <p>
                    The <code>matrix()</code> function specifies a 2D transform in a form of a <i>transformation matrix</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix)</a>. The function requires siz arguments, all of which are numbers seperated by commas.
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Tip</strong> Unless you are an expert in linear algebra (ako kay dele haha), you can forget about the <code>matrix()</code> function. Although it allows you to combine multiple transforms in a single operation, everthing that the <code>matrix()</code> function does can be achieved using the individual transform function described in the precedeing topics</h4>
                <p>
                    The last two arguments always specify the number of pixels you want to move (translate) the element along the horizontaland vertical axes, respectively. The first four arguments control other transforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most cases, the first and fourth arguments are the scaling factors for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The second argument usually controls the angle of vertical skew, while the third one controls horizontal skew. All four arguments are used in combination to rotate the element. What makes using the <code>matrix()</code> function complicated is the need to convert angles of skew and rotation using trigonometric functions.

                <p>
                    You specify the duration of the transition with <code>transition-duration</code> property, which expects a single duration or comma-seperated list of durations. Times can be set in seconds or thousandths of a second (ms). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you specify just one value, the same duration apllies to all properties being transitioned. If you supply multiple durations, they are applied to the properties in the same order as they are listed in transition-property.

                        <li><strong><code>ease-in</code></strong>Starts slow and speeds up</li>
                        <li><strong><code>ease-out</code></strong> Starts fast and slows towards the end</li>
                        <li><strong><code>ease-in-out</code></strong> Similar to ease, but slower at each end</li>

                    As with <code>transition-duration</code>, a single value is applied to all transition. If you specify multiple values as a comma-seperated list, they are applied in the same order to the individual propertues listed in transition-proerty. Excess values are ignored, and if you specify fewer transition-timing-function values than properties, the browser cycle through them.

                    The first five keywords in the preceeeding list are consntants for easing functions and based on a cubic-bezier curve. If you have used Flash, you will be famillar with the concept of <i>easing</i>, which varies the pace of a transition(or tweenm as its called Flash). The cubic-bezier() function allows you to customize the pace. It takes four arguments like border-top-right-radius
                    <div class="code" style="white-space: pre;">
<code>
cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2);
</code>
                    </div>
                    Both x1 and x2 must be in the range 0-1. The y1 and y2 values can exceed that range.

                    The <code>steps()</code> function takes two arguments: the number of discrete steps in the transition and the keyword <code>start</code> or <code>end</code>. If you omit the second argument, it defualts to <code>end</code>. Each changes color at a different pace

                    The <code>transition-duration</code> property is set to a deliberately long five seconds. The first two elements use the <code>steps()</code> function to change the color in five discrete steps. However, the timing is affected by the second argument. The first div uses start, to the color immediately changes to the first intermediate shade. In the next div, the second argument is end. As a result, the color does not change until the first second has passed. <br> The last two div elements use the <code>step-start</code> and <code>step-end</code> constants. The first changes color immediately on mouse over and mouseout. The last one does not change unless the mouse pointer is held over for full 2 seconds. When you mouse away from div. it does not rever to white until two seconds have passed.

                <h2>Delaying the Transition</h2>
                <p>
                    By default, transitions starts immediately, but you can use the <code>transition-delay</code> property to delay the whole or part of  a transition. Like the other transition properties, it accepts a single time value or a comma-seperated list of values. A single value applies to all properties being transitioned. A list of values is applied to properties in the same order as the are listed in <code>transition-property</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Delaying a propertys transition by the same amount as the previous propertys duration creates a sequence of changes. For example, the styles change the background color, width, and height of a box on hover like this:
                </p>
                <div class="con">
                    <div id="delay">

                    </div>
                    <div class="code">

    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    margin: 10px;
    transition-property: background-color, width, height;
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-delay: 0s, 1s, 2s;
}
#delay:hover{
    background-color: yellow;
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
}
                    </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Changing the Reverse Transition</h3>
                <p>
                    As the example from before, transition delays are executed in the same order as when the element returns to its normal state. In many cases, this is unlikely to cause a problem. But if you want to run a sequence of transition-reverse, its quite easy to do.
                    <p>
                        All thats needed is to define <code>transition-delay</code> in two places
                        <ul>
                            <li>The timings for the forward sequence go in the style rule that define the state after the transition, for example in the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class</li>
                            <li>The timings for the reverse sequence go in the style rule that defines the elements normal state</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        <div id="delay-rev">

                    </div>
                    <p>in <code>#delay-rev:hover</code> I added <code>transition-delay: 2s, 1s, 0s;</code> which reversed in the original <code>transition-delay</code> values</p>

            <h2>Using the Shorthand Property</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of using the individual properties, you can define a transition in a single declaration with the <code>transition</code> shorthand property. For a single property, just list the values seperated by spaces, For example, the following applies a one-second linear transition to <code>background-color</code>, delayed by a quarted of a second:
            </p>
            <div class="con">
                <div class="code">
transition: background-color 1s 250ms linear;
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><strong>To jump to the end state immediately after a delay, use a single time value equal to the length of the delay, and set the timing function to <code>step-end</code></strong> is 0s</p>
            <p>
                To apply transition values to all properties, just set the values you want to change from the initial values listed before. For example, if you want all properties to transition over half a second without delay, this is all you need:
                <div class="con">
                    <div class="code">
transition: 500ms;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, if you want to make it clear that all properties are affected, inlcude <code>all</code> keyword:
                </p>
                <div class="con">
                    <div class="code">
transition: all 500ms;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In both case, the default <code>ease</code> timing function will be used
                </p>
                <p>
                    To apply different values to each property, use multiple shorthand definition seperated by commas. For example the previous code to which there was delay, it can be wriiten like this
                </p>
                <div class="con">
                    <div class="code">
#delay-rev {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    margin: 10px;
    transition-property: background-color 1s 2s,
                         width 1s 1s, 
                         height 1s;
}
                    </div>
